## Description:-
My final project is a basic snake game. The objective of the game is to move a snake character around around the screen so that it can collect apples without crashing into the walls or crashing into itself. Each time the snake collects an apple its length increase and the player gains a point. The number of points the player has when the snake crashes into a wall or itself is the players final score. The libraries that I had to import for this project are pygame, time, and random. I used a tutorial to help me with this program but I also added the walls and the commands to end the end the game upon collision with the walls on my own.
